# History of India: Ancient to Medieval Period

India's rich historical heritage spans over 5,000 years, beginning with the Indus Valley Civilization and evolving through various dynastic periods that shaped the subcontinent's cultural, political, and social landscape.

## Indus Valley Civilization (3300-1300 BCE)

The Harappan Civilization, one of the world's earliest urban civilizations, flourished along the Indus River. Major cities like Harappa and Mohenjo-daro featured sophisticated urban planning with well-organized streets, drainage systems, and standardized weights and measures. The civilization demonstrated advanced knowledge of metallurgy, pottery, and trade networks extending to Mesopotamia and Central Asia.

## Vedic Period (1500-500 BCE)

The arrival of Indo-Aryans marked the beginning of the Vedic period, characterized by the composition of the Vedas - ancient Sanskrit texts containing hymns, rituals, and philosophical concepts. The Rigveda, the oldest Veda, provides insights into early Aryan society, religion, and culture. This period saw the development of the caste system and the establishment of kingdoms across northern India.

## Mauryan Empire (322-185 BCE)

Chandragupta Maurya founded the Mauryan Empire, which became India's first major centralized state. His grandson, Emperor Ashoka, expanded the empire across most of the Indian subcontinent. After the brutal Kalinga War, Ashoka embraced Buddhism and promoted non-violence, religious tolerance, and social welfare. His edicts, inscribed on rocks and pillars throughout the empire, remain important historical documents.

## Gupta Period (320-550 CE)

Known as India's Golden Age, the Gupta period witnessed remarkable achievements in science, mathematics, astronomy, literature, and arts. Mathematician Aryabhata calculated the value of pi and explained lunar eclipses. The decimal system and concept of zero originated during this era. Sanskrit literature flourished with works by Kalidasa, while universities like Nalanda attracted scholars from across Asia.

## Medieval India

The Delhi Sultanate (1206-1526) introduced Islamic architecture, administrative systems, and cultural synthesis between Hindu and Islamic traditions, laying foundations for the later Mughal Empire.

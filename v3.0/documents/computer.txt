# Computer Science: Algorithms and Data Structures

Computer Science encompasses the study of algorithms, data structures, programming languages, and computational systems. Understanding fundamental concepts in algorithms and data structures is essential for developing efficient software solutions and solving complex computational problems.

## Algorithm Analysis and Big O Notation

Algorithm analysis involves evaluating the efficiency of algorithms in terms of time and space complexity. Big O notation describes the upper bound of an algorithm's growth rate. Common complexities include O(1) for constant time, O(log n) for logarithmic time, O(n) for linear time, O(n log n) for linearithmic time, and O(n²) for quadratic time.

For example, binary search has O(log n) complexity because it eliminates half the search space with each comparison, while linear search requires O(n) time to check each element sequentially.

## Fundamental Data Structures

Arrays provide constant-time access to elements using indices but have fixed sizes in many languages. Linked lists offer dynamic sizing and efficient insertion/deletion but require sequential traversal for element access.

Stacks follow Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle, useful for function calls, expression evaluation, and backtracking algorithms. Queues implement First-In-First-Out (FIFO) ordering, essential for breadth-first search and scheduling systems.

Hash tables provide average O(1) lookup time using hash functions to map keys to array indices. Trees organize data hierarchically, with binary search trees offering O(log n) operations for balanced trees.

## Sorting and Searching Algorithms

Bubble sort has O(n²) complexity but is simple to implement. Merge sort achieves O(n log n) performance through divide-and-conquer approach. Quick sort also averages O(n log n) but can degrade to O(n²) with poor pivot selection.

Binary search requires sorted data but provides O(log n) search time. Hash-based searching offers O(1) average performance for key-value lookups.

## Modern Applications

These concepts form the backbone of modern computing: databases use B-trees for indexing, web servers implement hash tables for caching, and machine learning algorithms rely on efficient matrix operations and graph traversal techniques for neural network training and optimization.
